<!-- 
All pages are built using proper HTML structure:
The DOCTYPE and html elements are at the root of the structure.
The <head> element contains the title and any necessary meta information, including charset, description, and viewport.
The <body> element contains all the page content.
HTML5 semantic tags such as <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, etc. are used to add appropriate meaning to the code.
Each image has an ‘alt’ attribute that has a short but meaningful description of the image’s content.
Form input elements have the appropriate type and validation attributes.
Code passes the the W3C Markup Validation Service(opens in a new tab). -->
